# CryptoClustering

The goal for this challenge is to use Python and unsupervised learning to predict in cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

By running the code all the way though, you will see what the best value for k is by using the elbow curve. you will also see how clusering cryptocurrencies with K-means.
